# Product Mission

## Problem

This project serves as a learning platform for embedded Rust development, demonstrating modern systems programming techniques in a resource-constrained bare-metal environment.

## Target Users

Interview panel at an embedded systems company (HighQ.aero) evaluating technical proficiency in both Rust and C++ for embedded applications.

## Solution

Demonstrates modern Rust in an embedded context using `no_std`, showcasing memory safety and zero-cost abstractions without an operating system or standard library. The project highlights the viability of Rust as a safer alternative to C/C++ in safety-critical embedded systems.
